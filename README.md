# 21 Days

## Project Pitch

It is said that it takes 21 (straight) days to create a habit so our App is the perfect way to put it to the test!

- Is simple to use.
- Only 21 days.
- Has intuitive Check-in systems to check your daily habits.
- Has a progress tracking on the main screen so you can follow your journey.
- Proposes a selection of habits if you need any or more ideas to improve yourself.
- Has a Habit page so you can follow your progress and check-in past days habits if you happen to forget.

The remember that the small changes amount to great things and that the turtle won the race so no hurry.

## Why this project?

"We chose '21 Days' for several compelling reasons:

- Challenging: The project offered numerous exciting features to explore and develop.
- Teaching: The project allowed us to use learned during the module.
- Useful: We identified a gap in the market for a user-friendly habit-tracking app that aligns with our goals.
- Simple to start: we donâ€™t need to find free API. We used JSON server and Chat GPT for backend side.

## Main Challenges

Managing asynchronous calls: We overcame this by carefully debugging and put right order of these calls.

Dealing with time: We successfully integrated the Dayjs library to work with time effectively.

Responsive design: Achieving a balance between 4K screens and mobile phones was really hard but manageable.

- Data visualisation without libraries.
- We implemented Libraries like Dayj, Emoji-Picker-React and React-Toastify, Lodash.
- Live update of progress.
- Days / Time management.
- Manage Debouncing.
- And emojis! ðŸ˜œ

## Next Steps

Looking ahead, we have exciting plans to enhance '21 Days':

- Introduce login and sign-up pages for user accounts.
- Data-base for all history of habits.
- Implement a user statistics page with data on completed habits and current habits.
- Add a Save for the Future functionality, enabling users to save habits for later."
